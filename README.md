# Hospitality-Project

Hello Everyone!!!

I am thrilled to share my another project completion in Power BI. I have successfully completed my project in the "Hospitality Domain" and I have gathered insights for the revenue team of the "AtliQ Grands" to regain their market share and revenue.

# Learnings:
While doing this project I have learnt about the challenges in the hospitality domain and used my data analytical skills to address real world problems.

This dashboard is created for doing an overall analysis of the "AtliQ Grands" so that management can take well-informed decisions. I have summarised it in two pages (Overall Analysis 1 and 2) by creating important metrices and fruitful insights.

Using Power BI, I have created certain important key metrices such as ADR(Average Daily Rate), Occupancy%, Cancellation Rate%, Total Capacity, Total bookings(comprises of Total successful bookings, Total no show bookings, Total cancelled bookings) etc. and I have also learnt about bookmarks and selections for different purposes (Page navigations, Clear filter button) and made visuals that are generating meaningful insights for the revenue team at a different time period.

Its been a great learning experience exploring this new domain. Each and every domain has its own unique challenges to find out about.
